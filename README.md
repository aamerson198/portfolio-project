# portfolio-project

This project was built from scratch using Bootstrap components and custom code.

The About Me page features a picture of the site builder as well as a brief paragraph giving a bio.

The portfolio paage is a list of thumbnail images that would link to actual projects that the author worked on. In this casr there were no actual portfolio projects so the links are simply dummmy links for now.

The contact page features more bootstrap components brought together to make a form that includes input sections for name, email address, as well as a message section.
